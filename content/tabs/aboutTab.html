<h2>CCDump - Cycle Collector Heap Dump</h2>
<p>Display the graph created by cycle collector - use when hunting down memory leaks.</p>
<p>Author: Jan Odvarko, odvarko@gmail.com</p>

<br/>

<h3>Tips</h3>
See some tips about how to use this extension.
<ol>
<li><p>You mostly want to start by clicking on <b>Run CC Analysys</b>
button in the <b>Home</b> tab. After you do it, Firefox cycle collector runs
three times to clean up garbage and consequently once, with a listener, to collect entire
CC heap graph of objects in the memory. The result object graph is immediatelly displayed 
as a table where each entry represents an object.</p></li>

<li><p>The prefered way how to explore the graph is to search it. Use a <b>search box</b>
located at the top right corner of the <b>Home</b> page. Note that if there is a string in
the box the search runs automatically just after analysys.</p></li>

<li><p>You will typically look for documents that shouldn't be in the memory since the
parent tab has been already closed (so called zombie documents). Just search for
<code>nsDocument</code> or pick <b>Find Zombie Documents</b> from the search option menu.
You can also search for <code>http</code> to get all zombie elements.
</p></li>

<li><p>You can search for any other keywords within object's name or use object's address.
You can also use <b>regular expressions</b>.</p></li>

<li><p>As soon as you have some search results, e.g. <i>zombie documents</i>, you can continue
exploring object graph related to the selected document. Click the small black triangle next
to object's name and pick one of the options.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Show Details</i> - See detailed information about the object.</li>
    <li><i>Show Roots</i> - See root objects that keeps this object in the memory.</li>
    <li><i>Show Graph</i> - See entire graph of all related objets as a expandable tree.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Especially <b>Show Graph</b> allows to dramatically reduce the object graph to see
only related objects and search further.</p></li>

<li><p>Note that this is a <b>bootstrapped</b> extension and so, you can install it
any time when you experience a memory leak in your running browser and immediatelly start
exploring your current CC graph (without browser restart).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Object Fields</h3>
You can see following fileds when dealing with objects in the graph.

<ul>
<li><i>name</i> - objects name generated by CC collector</li>
<li><i>address</i> - unique hexadecimal address of the object</li>
<li><i>refcount</i> - number of objects referencing the object</li>
<li><i>gcmarked</i> - if <code>false</code> CC is OK with freeing the object</li>
<li><i>root</i> - if <code>true</code> the object is a root</li>
<li><i>edges</i> - array of objects referenced by this object</li>
<li><i>owners</i> - array of parent objects referencing this object</li>
</ul>

<h3>API</h3>
The extension is build on top of <code>nsICycleCollectorListener</code> interface
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726346">introduced</a> in Firefox 13.
